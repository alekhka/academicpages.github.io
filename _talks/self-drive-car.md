Trained and implemented a neural network to drive a car. Aimed at making self driving feature available to all cars. Made a system which can be
used as an add-on over existing cars. Trained a Neural Network using OpenCV. The whole system was built with least cost
possible. Added multi-threading to significantly reduce the latency of the system. The system was considered to be one of the best at Mercedes-Benz hack.bangalore.
