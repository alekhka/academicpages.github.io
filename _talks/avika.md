Developed a voice controlled system for blind people to help in their day-to-day activities.
The system accepted voice commands and all outputs were voice - alleviating the need
for point-click or keyboard which is very tough/impossible for the blind. Responded to commands like "play music", "search for", "navigate" etc. Implemented OCR functionality to read books when the user issues "read book"
command. Implemented home automation to control appliances like light bulbs, fans etc. through voice commands.
